# Why genomics?

1. Genomics

- Genomics is study of genomes inside of living creature.
- Small number of changes in our genome can create a difference 
with the others.
- Researcher want to know what is the things that driving all the differences
- The basic things that our genome determines is how our bodies develop. Start
with single cell which makes a copy and quickly divides into embryo, and
eventually into the whole person.
- This development is programmed and encoded in our genome. this is a mistery.
- The code in the program can determines all difference cell types, such as
how to make a neuron which very complex cell.

2. Current research focus
- Understand what is going on in the cell even though it has the same program, the same code, somehow it's executing a different program to make it into a neuron versus a skin cell.
- Genomics in cancer which is a genetic disease. So, basically cell in our
body have the same genetic code, but somehow they started replicating without control.
